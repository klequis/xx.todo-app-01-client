client have:
- one route for success response
- second route for error response



## Projects
- tmp-client: working on
- client: ts client, use for redux implementation
- real-world: use monitor implementation from this
- redux edge: oribinal createRequestThunk
- server: current todo server

## 1. finish current work (what is the form problem)
   - form issue fixed
   - added ErrorPane
   - done

## 2. implement redux per 'client'

### Packages added
  - react-redux
  - redux
  - redux-thunk
  - redux-devtools-extension
  - done

## 3. use recommended libraries from redux doc such as cross-fetch, babel polyfill, etc

### Packages added

Per Redux doc
  - babel-polyfill
  - cross-fetch
Put ...
```js
import 'babel-polyfill'
```
... before all other code

## 4. implement monitor per 'real-world'

## 5. modify createRequestThunk to take single actions instead of arrays of actions (trial)
